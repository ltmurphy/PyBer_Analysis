# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis with Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook:
___
### Purpose

The purpose of our analysis was to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data using Python and Pandas. The next step was to use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multi-linegraph that helped visualize the total weekly fares by city type. Finally a written report on the analysis was generated to highlight how the data differs by city type. This report will be used by decision-makers at PyBer

### PyBer Analysis Results

* As you can see from the image below there is a definite difference between the type of city and the number of drivers, rides, and fares, as well as the average fares.

* Total rides, drivers and fare numbers increase the more urbanized the city is. On the other end of the spectrum average fare per ride and average fare per driver decrease the more urbanized the envoronment.

* The above graph shows the total fare by city type from January through April. Starting in January, the totals in all cities trend upwards with a noticable dip across the board occurring after February. The totals are back on the rise by March. During April both Rural and Urban cities start to decline with Rural diving back down to its starting numbers. Suburban, however, is rising and headed toward its highest numbers yet.

### PyBer Analysis Summary

Based on the analysis the total number of drivers, riders, and fares is directly proportional to the urbanization of the city. Conversely the average fare per ride and per driver are inversely related to the urbanization of the city. The total fares for all city types reflect this but we see a noticable rise in Suburban fares at the end of April. Our analysis seeks not only to highlight these disparities, but help address them. To that order the following business recommendations are made:

1. Add "peak" time incentives based on location to help concentrate drivers into specific areas whenever there is a noticable opportunity for a high earning period. This will help allocate the drivers more efficiently to help provide the most opportunity for profit.

2. Subsidize the earnings of the drivers in Rural areas, possibly with a unique rotating driver selection. This will help ensure the large fares in Rural cities aren't missed and will prompt an increase in driver interest in Rural areas. This will help increase awareness and use.
 
3. Add an "active riders" count to the driver user interface and anchor it to a radius around each driver. Also provide it for the local region as a whole. This will help the drivers track their best opportunity for earning in real time.
