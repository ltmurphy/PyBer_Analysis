# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis with Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook:

### Purpose

The purpose of our analysis was to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data using Python and Pandas. The next step was to use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multi-linegraph that helped visualize the total weekly fares by city type. Finally a written report on the analysis was generated to highlight how the data differs by city type. This report will be used by decision-makers at PyBer

### PyBer Analysis Results

* As can be observed from the below figure and table presented, there is a trend between population of a city and total number of rides. This relationship directly influences the total fare and drivers, as well as the averages of these per city.

* Total ride, driver and fare numbers decrease the more rural and farther away from urban cities we go. Directly inverted, average fare per ride and average fare per driver increases as we approach more rural and less urbanized areas.

* This is can be explained using supply and demand laws. There are less drivers in rural areas which consequently leads to a higher average fare per ride and driver. The lower supply for a demanded service, the higher the price.

* Using this multiple-line graph, we have the possibility to analyze total fares by city type from January 1st, 2019 to  April 29th, 2021. Over this 4 month period, we can determine that similar trends are noticeable for all three different types of cities with constant increase/decrease in fare rates throughout. The only notable fall in fare rate is seen for Suburban cities towards the end of February. Fares are noticeably lower here, only seeming to pick back up towads the start of May.

### PyBer Analysis Summary

In order to address as many of the disparities observed among the city types, our analysis prompts the following three business recommendations:

1.  Allocate more drivers to rural areas for optimal profits. There are no significant price drops in the total fare for rural cities. According to the line graph, this type of city would provide a steady income. 

2. Redistribute suburban drivers to urban/rural areas mid-February to avoid any huge losses in this type of city during this period, with the option of bringing back this staff mid-April when total fare seems to increase again.
 
3. Decrease number of drivers for urban cities. There are currently 780 more drivers than rides for Urban cities, and costs are incurred for the company for those drivers even if they do not have rides to give. Redistribution of these drivers to Suburban/Rural areas would help mitigate costs and potentially even increase profits.# PyBer_Analysis
